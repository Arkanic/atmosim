### instructions

1. make sure you have g++ ready and run build.bat
2. run `atmosim.exe -h` in your favourite console terminal
3. enjoy

also oh yeah you have to recompile it to change some things, like what parameter it optimises for, go modify optimiseStat() to return whatever you want to maximise
